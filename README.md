Hi, I'm Pranav 👋
I do many things, including:

Designing simple yet intuitive apps in Python with PySide2 like Weather 🌤
Developing interesting (but still boring) games in Python
Designing minimal and intuitive CSS frameworks like minimal.css 🤔
Creating powerful but lightweight prompts for bash like neat 🤪
I have many more projects, nearly all of which I am going to open source when they are ready. If you find any of my projects inspiring, revolutionary, or interesting, please give them a ⭐️ so I know they are appreciated.

If you want to contact me, please open an issue over here.
