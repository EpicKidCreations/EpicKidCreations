Hi, I'm Pranav 👋
I do many things, including:

Designing simple yet intuitive apps in Python 🌤 
Experienced in Python, a bit Javascript, Html, and Css
I have many more projects, nearly all of which I am going to open source when they are ready. If you find any of my projects inspiring, revolutionary, or interesting, please give them a ⭐️ so I know they are appreciated.

If you want to contact me, please open an issue over here.
